Woke up to golden sunlight streaming through my window, painting everything in a warm, buttery hue. Made a cup of tea and watched the steam curl like little spirits from a Ghibli film. 

Today, I tried to notice the small wonders: the way leaves danced in the breeze, the gentle hum of the city, the comfort of a well-worn book. Sometimes, the most magical moments are the quietest ones.
